## Super-Resolution using Fluctuating Intensity (SRRF, ESI, SOFI, etc..)

Using SRRF from the Henrique lab it's possible to quickly increase the resolution even without complicated STORM protocols:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/image_1.png" width="500">
</p>

The image of actin labelled HUVEC cells is acquired using a 60x, 0.85NA objective lens. While moving the coupling lens, the varying intensity pattern caused by a changing mode field pattern can be used to increase the lateral resolution of fluorescently labeled samples at low excitation power. This is suitable for live-cell imaging.

## Super-Resolution using SMLM (*d*STORM)

With high enough coupling efficiency and laser intensity, the setup enables super-resolution with a final resolution <100nm on a large field of view (FOV). This is well suited not only for educational purposes, but also for research outside the ordinary research and optics labs.

# Software

As the software we relied on three different APPs for recent Android phones (in our case Huawei P20 Pro).

Briefly summarized and in-detail described below:

|  Name | Purpose  |  Source  |
|  STORM-Controler | Remote control (MQTT) to control things like laser intensity, coupling lens, focus  |  [APP: STORM-Controler](https://github.com/beniroquai/dSTORM-on-a-Chi-ea-p/tree/master/ANDROID/STORM-Controller)  |
|  STORM-Imager | Control long-term image acquisition by enabling auto-focus and auto-coupling, schedule fluctuating intensity measurements inside incubators   |   [APP: STORM-Imager](https://github.com/beniroquai/dSTORM-on-a-Chi-ea-p-ANDROID)  |
|  FreeDCam | Full control over the cellphones camera: RAW and video image acquisition |   [FreeDCam](https://github.com/beniroquai/FreeDcam/tree/cellstorm) |
|  ImJoy Fiji.JS Learn2Sofi | Fiji.JS Plugin to process temporal stacks made by Wei @ ImJoy | [![launch ImJoy](https://imjoy.io/static/badge/launch-imjoy-badge.svg)](https://ij.imjoy.io/?plugin=https://gist.github.com/oeway/11cc4c3eea5646ec41e0c7a7a1957023&open=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beniroquai/dSTORM-on-the-chea-i-p-Learn2Fluct/master/TF2_KERAS/testdata/03_measurment_ecoli_sofi_timeseries_txy.tif#) |

## Android APP: STORM-Controler

To control the Lens or Laser using a customized MQTT controler APP, you can visit this repository:

[APP: STORM-Controler](https://github.com/beniroquai/dSTORM-on-a-Chi-ea-p/tree/master/ANDROID/STORM-Controller)

This app allows basic hardware controls:
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/cellSTORM_app.png" width="200">
</p>

## Android APP: STORM-Imager

This is the APP which can record images, control the device and predict a super-resolved result form the camera live stream. The APP can be found here:

[APP: STORM-Imager](https://github.com/beniroquai/dSTORM-on-a-Chi-ea-p-ANDROID)


### Autofocus inside the APP:

It's just an example how the cellphone maintains the focus. This is done by maximizing the focus metric (i.e. standard deviation over z) as a function of the focus motor position.

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/autofocus.gif" width="300">
</p>


### SOFI-based superresolution imaging inside the APP:

This is an example of the SOFI-based superresolution imaging using the neural network mentioned below. We used fixed *e.coli* labelled with ATTO 647.
The fluctuation of the illumination is the result of the discrete mode pattern in the singlemode waveguide chip. The input field changes the intensity pattern.   

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/ondevicesr.gif" width="300">
</p>

## Android APP: FreeDCam (cellSTORM module)

For the *d*STORM experiments we used the open source APP [FreeDCam](https://github.com/beniroquai/FreeDcam/tree/cellstorm) originally developed and mainted by [killerink](https://github.com/KillerInk/FreeDcam). We provide a modified version for the Huawei P9 and P20 which is used in this work. It enables

1. fast read-out and saving of cropped RAW frames to the SD-cad
2. stream the RAW buffer to a c-server

To stream the data to a server [this manual](https://github.com/beniroquai/FreeDcam/tree/cellstorm/server_mac) gives some more detailed information. It requires Android Studio which compiles the c program into an executable. Inside the APP you need to select the IP of the server.

Many thanks to [@Killerink](https://github.com/KillerInk/) to make this work!

### Settings for FreeDCam (Huawei P20 Pro)

We used the following settings:

***Video Settings:***
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/ScreenshotFreedcamSettings (2).jpg" width="200">
</p>

***General Settings:***
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/ScreenshotFreedcamSettings (3).jpg" width="300">
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/ScreenshotFreedcamSettings (4).jpg" width="300">
</p>

***Acquisition Settings:***
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/ScreenshotFreedcamSettings (1).jpg" width="300">
</p>


## NN-based Super-Resolution Imaging: "Learn2Fluct"

The python and tensorflow-based neural network to use "SOFI"-like image reconstruction based on ```convLSTM2D``` layers on a cellphone can be found here:

[Neural Network](https://github.com/beniroquai/dSTORM-on-the-chea-i-p-Learn2Fluct)

It aims to transfer a stack of noisy low resolution images with varying illumination pattern:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/mytest_obj-2.gif" width="300">
</p>

into high resolution images:

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/mytest_gt-1.png" width="300">
</p>

It is part of the APP "STORM-Imager" and can be used as an interactive website (Live-Demo). To train the model have a look in the recent ```Tensorflow==2.3.0``` implementation using ```Keras```  and ```TFLite``` which can be found in the Github-Reopository [here](https://github.com/beniroquai/dSTORM-on-the-chea-i-p-Learn2Fluct/tree/master/TF2_KERAS).

### Live-Demo using Webcam

We implemented a live-demo of the pre-trained SOFI-network which is available [here](./STORMjs/index.html). It runs in Javascript and does not transfer any (!) data to the internet. It runs locally once the model of the neural network is downloaded.

***Note:*** It's in an experimental stage. It's not optimized for performance. We do not guarantee for proper functionality. Use it on your own risk!

<p align="center">
<img src="./images/cellstorm_tensoflowjs_screenshot.png" width="500">
</p>

The model was tested on a Macbook Pro using a Chrome browser which runs at *~1fps*.


### ImJoy Plugin
[![launch ImJoy](https://imjoy.io/static/badge/launch-imjoy-badge.svg)](https://ij.imjoy.io/?plugin=https://gist.github.com/oeway/11cc4c3eea5646ec41e0c7a7a1957023&open=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beniroquai/dSTORM-on-the-chea-i-p-Learn2Fluct/master/TF2_KERAS/testdata/03_measurment_ecoli_sofi_timeseries_txy.tif#)

Wei made an awesome plugin for the browser-based FiJi which encapsulates the Javascript LiveDemo into a Fiji.JS applet. Very easy to use and beware: No installation necessary!!

Go to the [ImJoy-Plugin Webpage](https://ij.imjoy.io/?plugin=https://gist.github.com/oeway/11cc4c3eea5646ec41e0c7a7a1957023&open=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beniroquai/dSTORM-on-the-chea-i-p-Learn2Fluct/master/TF2_KERAS/testdata/03_measurment_ecoli_sofi_timeseries_txy.tif#)

It will automatically load a sample TIF-Stack which you can find [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beniroquai/dSTORM-on-the-chea-i-p-Learn2Fluct/master/TF2_KERAS/testdata/03_measurment_ecoli_sofi_timeseries_txy.tif)

***Starting the Plugin:***
Opening the plugin is as easy as selecting it from the ImJoy Icon on the left hand side:
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/ImJoy_screenshotCapture.PNG" width="300">
</p>

***Executing the Plugin:***
Once you hit the Learn2SOFI button it will propagate the image stack through the network which looks like this after processing:
<p align="center">
<img src="./images/ImJoy_screenshotCapture_2.PNG" width="300">
</p>

You can start playing with your own data by uploading you own time stack. It has to have the following dimensions: ```Nx=128, Ny=128, t=30```

EnJoy! :-)
